" With rebellions, internal squabbles within the Mahayuti and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), and the several nominations which have been filed, Maharashtra Assembly elections, slated to take place in a single phase on November 20, have confounded many pollsters. Just like the confusion about the seat-sharing formula, the fights will also be clearer only once the last day of the withdrawal of nominations on November 4 is over. Currently, looking at the several nominations which have been filed by the official candidates, rebel independent candidates and the smaller parties, Maharashtra is slated to have many multi-cornered fights. ",rebellion internal squabble within mahayuti maha vikas aghadi mva several nomination filed maharashtra assembly election slated take place single phase november confounded many pollster like confusion seatsharing formula fight also clearer last day withdrawal nomination november currently looking several nomination filed official candidate rebel independent candidate smaller party maharashtra slated many multicornered fight
"Interestingly, despite the agrarian distress, the unemployment levels, these may not become poll issues, say experts. The key to power will likely be decided by Vidarbha where both the Congress and the BJP are directly pitted against each other. The party which will dominate in the 62 seats in Vidarbha will likely hold the key to Maharashtra’s power equation.",interestingly despite agrarian distress unemployment level may become poll issue say expert key power likely decided vidarbha congress bjp directly pitted party dominate seat vidarbha likely hold key maharashtra power equation
"This is the first State election where the factions of the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party will contest in an all-stakes fight against each other in their traditional strongholds. Sharad Pawar, whose party is fighting in 87 seats, will push to maintain his stronghold on the sugar-rich western Maharashtra belt. The land of education and sugar barons holds key to 70 of the 288 seats. Ajit Pawar-led NCP will fight in over 53 seats. “There seems to be a clear advantage to Sharad Pawar, particularly in western Maharashtra. He has chosen the candidates very strategically. He has good support in the younger population. In terms of the appeasement of communities as well, he has given tickets to Marathas and Dhangars to get his poll equations right,” said Vivek Bhavsar, political commentator and senior journalist.",first state election faction shiv sena nationalist congress party contest allstakes fight traditional stronghold sharad pawar whose party fighting seat push maintain stronghold sugarrich western maharashtra belt land education sugar baron hold key seat ajit pawarled ncp fight seat seems clear advantage sharad pawar particularly western maharashtra chosen candidate strategically good support younger population term appeasement community well given ticket maratha dhangars get poll equation right said vivek bhavsar political commentator senior journalist
"“This time, it isn’t one election in Maharashtra. The State faces 288 elections in 288 constituencies. It will truly be an unprecedented election which will be a nightmare for the pollsters as nobody is in a position to predict the outcome. My assessment is, like the 1999 elections, there will be several independent candidates who will emerge as winners. And after the results, they will become the kingmakers, leading to the possibility of horse-trading. Even smaller margins will flip the game in the State,” Girish Kuber, Editor, Loksatta, told The Hindu.",time isnt one election maharashtra state face election constituency truly unprecedented election nightmare pollster nobody position predict outcome assessment like election several independent candidate emerge winner result become kingmaker leading possibility horsetrading even smaller margin flip game state girish kuber editor loksatta told hindu
"The Mahayuti government banks on the success of the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana to garner the votes of women. “It will primarily help [Chief Minister] Eknath Shinde, who has aggressively campaigned for it as his scheme,” said Mr. Bhavsar. And because the BJP has done an outreach towards several smaller communities, particularly reaching out to the OBCs; the Kunbis and the OBCs might lend their support to the BJP. But none of the political parties, particularly in the Opposition, seem to be speaking about the issues related to agriculture or youth employment.",mahayuti government bank success mukhyamantri majhi ladki bahin yojana garner vote woman primarily help chief minister eknath shinde aggressively campaigned scheme said mr bhavsar bjp done outreach towards several smaller community particularly reaching obcs kunbis obcs might lend support bjp none political party particularly opposition seem speaking issue related agriculture youth employment
"“Unfortunately, this looks to be an issue-less election. There is not a single issue that will stand out. There are serious issues like agrarian crisis, Maharashtra’s decline in overall industrialisation, social tension. But none of them will get reflected in this election,” Mr. Kuber said.",unfortunately look issueless election single issue stand serious issue like agrarian crisis maharashtra decline overall industrialisation social tension none get reflected election mr kuber said
"The Congress and the MVA have claimed that they will be able to carry ahead the momentum of the Lok Sabha election results where the MVA had received wider support as compared to the Mahayuti. But months after the elections, that impact seems to have weaned away, say experts. While the Congress feels encouraged that it will lead in the Vidarbha region where it is confident of moving ahead of the BJP, the BJP feels it will be able to work its way through the region. “I don’t see the effect of Lok Sabha elections. Had the Maharashtra elections been held with the Haryana elections, things would have been different. But now, welfarism will come into play,” said Mr. Kuber, adding that the Manoj Jarange Patil factor might not have a wider impact on the election results.",congress mva claimed able carry ahead momentum lok sabha election result mva received wider support compared mahayuti month election impact seems weaned away say expert congress feel encouraged lead vidarbha region confident moving ahead bjp bjp feel able work way region dont see effect lok sabha election maharashtra election held haryana election thing would different welfarism come play said mr kuber adding manoj jarange patil factor might wider impact election result
